#Ansible Playbook - YAML file

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding my Ansible playbook, which has been configured to run solely on my local host. As a beginner in Ansible, I aim to explain each input and output line in detail, shedding light on how the playbook operates and interacts with the local environment. This guide is designed to help new users grasp the basics of Ansible automation and understand how to effectively use it for local tasks.
